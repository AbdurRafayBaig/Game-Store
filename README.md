# Game-Store
This is a complete database-driven web application that simulates a functional online game store. The system allows users to create accounts, browse and purchase games, manage their shopping cart, and place orders. An admin panel is also included for backend data management, providing full control over the content of the store.

**Project Overview** <br>
The Game Store System is designed to handle both user-side functionality and admin-level operations. It connects seamlessly with a SQL Server database to manage user credentials, product listings, orders, and other dynamic data.

**Core Features** <br>
**User Signup & Login** <br>
New users can register, and returning users can securely log in using stored database credentials.

G**ame Browsing and Cart** <br>
Users can search for available games, view product details, and add items to their shopping cart.

**Order Placement** <br>
The system supports order processing with a dedicated order page linked to the database.

**Admin Functionality** <br>
Admin users have access to a separate panel for:
Viewing all database records
Adding, updating, and deleting game listings
Managing featured game categories

**Static Pages** <br>
Includes About Us and other supporting pages to complete the user experience.

**Technologies Used** <br>
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js
Database: SQL Server (GAMESTOREDB.sql)

**Project Files** <br>
index.html, product.html, order.html, etc. – UI Pages
server.js – Node.js backend logic
*.js – JavaScript files for client-side behavior
GAMESTOREDB.sql – Database schema and data
about.html, database.html – Informational and admin interfaces

This project reflects a real-world implementation of SQL database integration in a full-stack web application. It combines user interface design, backend logic, and database connectivity to build a functional and maintainable system.
